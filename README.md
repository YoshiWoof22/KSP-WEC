# KSP-WEC
Repository about my Kerbal Space Program RSS/RO/RP-1 "WEC Aerospace" Career and related configs - which has been going since 2021.

[>>> RO/RP1 Custom Configs <<<](https://github.com/YoshiWoof22/KSP-WEC/tree/master/Configs)

### Configs:
Due to my career headcanon taking a slightly more alt-history approach, I've made some configs over the years to tweak a few things - some minor, some major.

A few of the original changes have since been incorporated into base RO/RP-1, or are included in other balance patches (e.g. ones from the "For All Kerbalkind" install).

However, [I am keeping the still-relevant ones here](https://github.com/YoshiWoof22/KSP-WEC/tree/master/Configs) for the sakes of completeness. **Some are "unbalanced" (unlocked early) for the sakes of pre-planning**.

Use the configs at your own discretion or modify them if needed (see [Usage](#usage-and-redistribution)).

> Should you want to look at the old and potentially outdated configs, they can be found in [this repository's "old" Branch](https://github.com/YoshiWoof22/KSP-WEC/tree/old).

### kOS (Kerbal Operating System) Scripts:
Not much to say about these. [You can find them here.](https://github.com/YoshiWoof22/KSP-WEC/tree/master/kOS).

Credit to all the amazing folks on the Forums, Reddit and Discord that freely share their kOS stuff.
Individual credits are per-script.

### Usage and Redistribution
Feel free to use the kOS scripts and custom configs provided in this Repository, and get inspired by or make derivatives of them - after all, that's is how these came to be.

All I ask is that you provide credit where credit is due, and perhaps link back to this repository and/or mention my username.

Because I need to mention this somewhere:
> I take absolutely no responsibility for anything unexpected or catastrophic that happens as a result of using these configs and/or scripts. They are provided AS-IS, WITHOUT warranty of any kind. **You have been warned.**
