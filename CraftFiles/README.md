# KSP // WESA (Woof Engineering & Space Agency)

### Required Mods/Addons:
Here is a list of the mods I have in use for most of my craft files - this list might be incomplete.

The KSP Version is currently 1.8.1, but should work fine in more up-to-date versions too:
- RO Suite
- Conformal Decals
- Aviation Lights
- Internal RCS
- Simple Procedural Engines
- B9 Procedural Wings
- Ven's Stock Revamp
- All of my **WEC Patches**
- ...probably some more I'm forgetting

### Any I/O (Idiot Operator) errors are not my responsibility:
- If you don't know how to use my crafts, RFTM - that's why I have them.
- If you still don't get it - don't whine and tell people it doesn't work. Instead...
- ...if you're struggling, ask me - see the last point in this file for more info about that.

### That being said, please be aware: 
I make and share these craft files for fun - and whilst I ensure they work (for me), I can't guarantee they'll do the same for you.
Each craft file has a small ReadMe file in the craft series/category's respective folder - it contains info on how to operate the craft, and other important notes.

### One final thing:
If you wanna share modified versions of these crafts, please provide credit and don't claim them as your own.
I take a lot of time and effort to optimise these vehicles and make them work as nicely as possible.

### Okay, final final thing:
If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to drop me a ping on the **KSP-RO** or **N0 Gaming** Discord - you should be able to find me there, especially on the latter.
